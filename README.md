# passwordvalidator-1st-
this is my first project which checks that the given password is valid or not by checking the following conditions :
*min length is 6   
*max length is 15   
*should contain at least one number   
*should contain atleast one special character(&amp;,+,@,$,#,%...etc)  
*should contain atleast one uppercase letter
